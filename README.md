# 🌍✨ LumaLandsat

LumaLandsat is a satellite-based platform designed to help farmers monitor and manage their crops more efficiently using real-time data. By leveraging Landsat 8 and 9 satellite imagery, the platform delivers critical insights on 🌾 crop health, 🌿 land use, and 🌦️ environmental conditions, enabling farmers to optimize resource usage, predict yields, and manage their fields with greater precision.

## 🚀 How It Works:

- **LumaLandsat** collects data from Landsat satellites, focusing on specific areas defined by the user (target pixels) 🌐.
- Provides a 3x3 grid centered on the user’s location, offering detailed data on crop health and key indicators like **NDVI** 📊.
- Users can customize the notification lead time for satellite overpasses 🛰️ and choose the method of notification 🔔.
- Filter data based on cloud cover ☁️ and select specific timeframes for satellite acquisitions 🗓️.
- Visualize data on maps 🗺️, download reports in CSV format 📄, and view spectral signatures that reflect crop health over time 📈.
